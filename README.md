# Roll the Bones

Roll the Bones is an actually good online dice roller. There weren't any really good ones, so I'm making one. No offense, I mean the ones out there technically work... but this is one is going to be rad as hell.

### Already Implemented Features

 - 2D dice physics and hit detection
 - No ads

### Obvious Planned Features

 - Every kind of die imaginable
 - Doing all the math for you
 - Drag and throw dice to roll
 - A cool logo and intro animation

### SUPER COOL PLANNED FEATURES

 - Shake your phone to roll the dice!
 - Dice skins and table themes!
 - Cool animations for crit successes and crit fails!
 - Advantage and disadvantage dice!
 - Settings menu where you can:
   - customize basically any of the features above
   - toggle AUTO-EXPLODING DICE
   - adjust your crit range and boring stuff like that
   - See my cute face in a credits screen and maybe donate to my kofi(???)

### Unknown Possible Dream Features

 - Haptic feedback when dice hit an edge (don't even know if there's a web API for phone vibration, maybe impossible?)
 - Sounds? I feel like nobody wants sounds. I know I don't at least... but maybe some day.
 - Presets like Fireball Dice (lots and lots of little orange D6s that leave a fire trail)
 - Some kind of reward for donating or something? I don't know about this one. I mean I want to keep every part of this free.
 - Saving your settings. Now, this sounds like an obvious feature... but it would mean one of those big horrible Cookies Policy legal notices over part of the screen when you first visit. I DO NOT want to do that.
