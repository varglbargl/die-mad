# DIE MAD

DIE MAD is an actually good online dice roller. There weren't any really good ones, so I'm making one. No offense, I mean the ones out there technically work... but this one is gonna be rad as hell.

## Feature List

 - 💚 = done
 - 💛 = started
 - ♥️ = not started
 - 💜 = might not ever do... who knows

### Minimum Viable Product

 - 💚 2D dice physics and hit detection
 - 💚 Doing all the math for you
 - 💚 No ads

### Obvious Planned Features

 - 💚 Every kind of die imaginable
 - 💜 Drag and throw dice to roll (Without dice-on-dice hit detection, you should be able to drag dice off top of eachother without accidentally throwing it and losing your roll)
 - 💛 A cool logo and intro animation
 - 💛 A passable modern UI

### SUPER COOL PLANNED FEATURES

 - 💚 Shake your phone to roll the dice!
 - 💛 Dice skins and table themes!
 - 💚 Cool animations for crit successes and crit fails!
 - ♥️ Advantage and disadvantage dice!
 - ♥️ Mario Paint/KidPix Studio style table clearing spells!
 - 💛 Settings menu where you can:
   - 💛 customize basically any of the features above
   - 💚 toggle AUTO-EXPLODING DICE
   - ♥️ adjust your crit range and boring stuff like that
   - 💜 See my cute face in a credits screen and maybe donate to my kofi(???)

### Impossible/Questionable/Stupid Features

 - 💜 Dice rolling animations (Look, there's only so much I can do before it gets too laggy. The web just wasn't built for this.)
 - 💚 Haptic feedback when dice hit an edge (don't even know if there's a web API for phone vibration. EDIT: THERE IS!!)
 - 💜 Sounds? I feel like nobody wants sounds. I know I don't at least... but maybe some day.
 - 💜 Presets like Fireball Dice (lots and lots of little orange D6s that leave a fire trail)
 - 💜 Some kind of reward for donating or something? I don't know about this one. I mean I want to keep every part of this free.
 - 💜 Saving your settings. Now, this sounds like an obvious feature... but it would mean one of those big horrible Cookies Policy legal notices over part of the screen when you first visit. I DO NOT want to do that.
 - 💜 Literal Mode: Actually rolling bones for performing digital geomancy
 - 💜 Dice with all custom faces, not just numbers (why tho?)
